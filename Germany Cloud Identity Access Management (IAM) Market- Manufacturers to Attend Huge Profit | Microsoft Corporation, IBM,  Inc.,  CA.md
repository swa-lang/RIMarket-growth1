<strong>Cloud Identity Access Management (IAM) Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Identity access management (IAM) is a security framework which ensures secure access to end users across multiple applications. Cloud IAM service provides secure and identity-based access to various industry verticals such as BFSI, IT & telecom, healthcare, media & entertainment, retail, education, and others. Cloud IAM services help various industrial verticals to manage security by permitting employee access with a user provision, multi-factor authentication, access management, directory management and few other services, thereby preventing the misuse of financial and corporate data. Hence, cloud IAM services are being widely adopted by large organizations, SMBs, and government agencies. Other features of cloud IAM such as single sign-on, access management, and other services, are less effective without user provisioning. However, multi-factor authentication would grow rapidly in the years to come owing to increasing demand for strong authentication. Cloud identity access management (IAM) is an approach to revamp the traditional IT security environment by offering IAM solutions over the cloud. At present, integration of IAM with the cloud is gaining pace owing to its low cost and enhanced security. Cloud IAM offers various services such as user provisioning, access management, multi-factor authentication, directory services, single sign-on (SSO), governance & compliance management and password management. Several organizations have adopted cloud IAM to improve customer engagement, acquisition, and retention. A well-designed cloud IAM system helps to prevent data security breach and thereby reduces the possible financial loss due to the same.
